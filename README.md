# Documents
Club documents has been migrated from Google Drive.

## Document List

1. Constitution (Regular text file, just without extension because `*.txt` is ugly)
2. Member List (CSV File, you can open it with Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc or Google Spreadsheet if you really want to. Binds pretty well with website too.)
3. Minutes Form (PDF is recommended, since it is not going to be modified often.)
4. Meeting Record (Probably, it will be on different branch, but we'll see.)
5. Rules (Regular text file, again, just without ugly `*.txt` extension.)

## Directories
* /Posters
  * Holds posters, obviously. Still, that doesn't mean that you can mess around with this directory without permission...
* /Extras
  * Holds useful informations about game development. This folder contains things like Game Proposal document guide, useful links, etc. This is the only directory that you can mess around with it, STILL YOU NEED TO MAKE A PULL REQUEST THOUGH. (No one wants a link to shock websites hanging out in the **Useful Links** document.)


## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CLUB CONSTITUTION
1. Fork the repository, or at least make a new branch, if you have an access to it. <br/> DO NOT DIRECTLY PUSH TO THE `master` BRANCH BECAUSE WE DO NEED EVERYONE TO REVIEW IT.
2. Make some changes.
3. Make a pull request, and notify to the board member.
